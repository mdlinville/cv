### About me

I’m a technical communicator with long experience working with open source software teams. I
translate the intent of engineers into information end users can act on, and I translate the needs
of end users into information engineers and project managers can use to improve the software.

Formal documentation is only the tip of the iceberg -- I have developed open source
contributor guides and I’ve improved logging messages, error strings, naming of
features and options, software workflows, and localization. My broad and deep
experience allows me to dive in and make meaningful contributions.

From August 2020 - April 2021, I was on sabbatical. During this time, I served
my local community in two different roles, as a production baker
and as a deli worker. It was fun and gratifying.

### Formal experience

#### **Staff Technical Writer** - Databricks, San Francisco, CA APR 2021 - PRESENT
- Document tasks related to administration, security, and networking

#### **Senior Technical Writer**​ — Google, San Francisco, CA FEB 2018 - AUG 2020
- Document software for several Google Cloud services, including:
  - **Cloud KMS, Cloud HSM, Cloud EKM​** -- managing and using cryptographic keys persisted in
    software, in an HSM, or in a key management system outside Google Cloud
  - **Kubernetes Engine (GKE)**​ -- deploy and manage applications deployed in Kubernetes
    Engine instances managed by Google Cloud
  - **Anthos Config Management**​ -- automate configuration and enforcement of business rules
    across fleets of GKE and Anthos clusters in Google Cloud, AWS, and other cloud
    Kubernetes providers

- Work with other documentation teams to document how to use our services together or in
  pipelines. For example, CMEK allows a customer to use Cloud KMS keys to encrypt data at rest
  in a plurality of other Google Cloud services.

- Contribute to open source Kubernetes documentation, review contributions from other writers,
  and help with governance of the documentation project

#### **Senior Technical Writer​** — Docker, San Francisco, CA AUG 2016 - FEB 2018
- Write core open source documentation for Docker, including tutorials, walkthroughs,
  conceptual explanations, application strings, API and CLI references.
- Collaborate with Docker engineers and external contributors on pull requests,
  issues, and design discussions as a committer and maintainer in good standing.
- Review and provide feedback on design documents, feature proposals, change requests, and
  design documents to prevent design mistakes, improve product quality and user experience, and
  ensure documentable and understandable features and products.
- Streamline publication workflows, collaboration, and automation of doc generation from code,
  so that writers can focus on writing narrative docs. Examples include a simple
  merge-to-publish workflow, sane branch management for documenting future-facing features, and
  tools to ensure that broken docs don’t get published.
- Migrate documentation from 20+ repositories to a single repository, while
  maintaining commit history of all objects, including 45000+ commits. This has
  enabled a huge measurable increase in doc contributions from Docker engineers
  and the community.

  and E-staff.

#### **Staff Technical Writer**​ — Cloudera, Brisbane Australia and San Francisco, CA APR 2014 - AUG 2016
- Architect, develop, maintain, and edit documentation for Cloudera products and
  open source projects. Open source work reduces the effort to productize upstream
  features and content.
- Write formal documentation and provide input on command-line usage instructions,
  error messages, UI flows and strings, metrics, and other areas of the product.
  Good product design and UX reduce the amount of documentation required.
- Coordinate with external contractor on ​docs site​ redesign. Implement 100% of
  design, CSS, and Javascript for mobile devices.
- Improve and automate docs workflows using a wide variety of tools, such as
  XSL-T, AsciiDoc, Markdown, Jenkins Job DSL, Python, Bash, and Groovy, so that
  writers can focus on non-automatable docs. Automate single-sourcing, testing,
  CI, and enforcement of compliance with style and editorial guidelines.
- Contribute documentation and code as a committer to Apache HBase and Apache
  Kudu and contribute to other open source projects.

#### **Middleware Documentation Manager**​ — Red Hat, Brisbane, Australia DEC 2011 - APR 2014
- Lead the documentation teams for each of Red Hat's Middleware products, with
  teams located in Australia, the US, the Czech Republic, and India, with many
  direct reports (40+ individual contributors, three supervisors, four software
  engineers developing tooling for Red Hat). Manage production and localization
  of documentation for 12+ products, each with multiple releases per year.
  Localization and accessibility work opened up new avenues of business with
  governments in China, Japan, France, and India.
- Propose, plan, hire, train, and manage a brand new team of technical writers
  in Pune, India, including in-person and remote leadership. Recruit, train, and
  develop a local supervisor for day-to-day supervision and mentoring of the team,
  which is still thriving nearly 10 years later. This effort saved Red Hat more
  than $1 million annually.

  transformation and translation tools vital to Red Hat.

  coordination as well as career development and team development.
